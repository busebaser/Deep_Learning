# Deep_Learning
This repository contains various neural networks and models that I created during the "Deep Learning" learning process.

# **In Keras dictionary, There are neural network projects that I created using the Keras library :**
  
  ann.py -> *Creating an Artificial Neural Network model using the MNIST dataset.*
  
  cnn.ipynb -> *Training and building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using the CIFAR-10 dataset.*
  
  lstm.ipynb -> *Model created using LSTM with the 20 Newsgroups dataset from the SkLearn library.*
  
  rbf.ipynb -> *Creating an ANN model with a Radial Basis Function layer using the Iris Dataset.*
  
  rnn.ipynb -> *Creating RNN model using Keras IMDB dataset*
  
  autoencoders -> *Image compression and reconstruction with autoencoders model using Fashion MNIST dataset.*
  
  transfer_learning.ipynb -> *Classifying drug and vitamin types using MobileNetV2 model with Transfer Learning.*

  dql_agent.ipynb -> *Training an agent in CartPole-v1 environment with Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm using Keras*
